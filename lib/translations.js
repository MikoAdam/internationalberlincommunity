Also when other companies ask to pay a lot of money, this organisation is just a couple of enthusiasts, who want to share their own hobby with others and together explore beauties of this world. Apart from that, you can always find a German speaking club or group to play board games with. So join and become the part of community, you will get so much fun.",
