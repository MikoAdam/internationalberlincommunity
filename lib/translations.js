    storyPara1: "The International Berlin Community (IBC) began in 2023 by organizing hikes. Hikes were free, accessible to everyone, and the easiest way to bring people together. From the very beginning, inclusivity and international character were central. Already at the first events, people from all over the world joined: students, expats, immigrants, refugees, and even diplomats.",
    storyPara2: "The idea quickly grew in popularity, and in 2024 we became a registered non-profit organization. As more volunteers got involved, the range of activities expanded beyond hikes. Today, IBC also organizes language exchanges, cultural celebrations such as Holi and Eid, multi-day trips even to other countries, guided tours, beach days, picnics, and book clubs.",
    storyPara3: "What started as a small volunteer initiative has become one of Berlin's most diverse international communities, where people from more than 100 nationalities meet, connect, and build lasting friendships. We now serve over 10,000 social media members and have organized 200+ events, demonstrating that meaningful integration happens through consistent, accessible community programming.",

Wanderungen waren kostenlos, für alle zugänglich und die einfachste Möglichkeit, Menschen zusammenzubringen. Von Anfang an standen Inklusivität und internationaler Charakter im Mittelpunkt. Bereits bei den ersten Veranstaltungen kamen Menschen aus der ganzen Welt: Studenten, Expats, Einwanderer, Geflüchtete und sogar Diplomaten.",
    storyPara2: "Die Idee gewann schnell an Popularität, und 2024 wurden wir ein eingetragener gemeinnütziger Verein. Als sich mehr Freiwillige engagierten, erweiterte sich das Angebot über Wanderungen hinaus. Heute organisiert IBC auch Sprachaustausch, kulturelle Feiern wie Holi und Eid, mehrtägige Reisen sogar in andere Länder, geführte Touren, Strandtage, Picknicks und Buchclubs.",
    storyPara3: "Was als kleine Freiwilligeninitiative begann, ist zu einer der vielfältigsten internationalen Communities Berlins geworden, wo Menschen aus mehr als 100 Nationen zusammenkommen, sich vernetzen und dauerhafte Freundschaften aufbauen. Wir betreuen über 10.000 Social-Media-Mitglieder und haben über 200 Veranstaltungen organisiert, was zeigt, dass sinnvolle Integration durch konsistente, zugängliche Gemeinschaftsprogramme geschieht.",
